# About The Game

In which we describe the game and how we created it.

# How To Play

## Installation

In which we include important details that will be needed to get and run the code.

Might be as simple as:

- `git clone` the project to get it onto your local machine
- compile the code with your handy dandy C compiler
  - this is `gcc game.c -o game` on my machine - A
- run the code as you would any other C program
  - this is `./game` on my machine - A

## Gameplay

In which we give a brief tutorial on how to actually play the game.

# Design Notes

In which we talk about any relevant things used to create the project. Probably specific to software design (memory management? ASCII art generator? Super powered machine learning models?) but also whatever we want.
